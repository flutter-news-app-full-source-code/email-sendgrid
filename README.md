This `email_sendgrid` package provides a concrete implementation of the `EmailClient` interface within the [**Flutter News App Full Source Code Toolkit**](https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code). It leverages the SendGrid v3 API to send transactional emails, offering a robust and reliable solution for email dispatch. Designed to be used with the `email_repository` and `http_client` packages, it utilizes the standardized `HttpClient` for making HTTP requests and handling errors, ensuring consistent behavior and robust error management. This package is crucial for backend services that require integration with a powerful email service provider.

<summary><strong>üß± Core Functionality</strong></summary>

### üöÄ `EmailClient` Implementation
- **`EmailSendGrid` Class:** A concrete implementation of the `EmailClient` interface, providing a standardized way to send emails via SendGrid.
- **SendGrid API Integration:** Connects directly to the SendGrid v3 API for sending transactional emails, ensuring reliable delivery.

### üåê Template-Based Email Sending
- **`sendTransactionalEmail` Method:** Supports sending emails using pre-defined SendGrid templates, allowing for dynamic content injection via `templateData`. This decouples email content and styling from application logic.

### üõ°Ô∏è Integrated Error Handling
- **`HttpClient` & `HttpException`:** Leverages the `http_client` package for underlying HTTP communication and propagates standardized `HttpException` errors (from `core`), ensuring consistent and predictable error management.

### üíâ Dependency Injection Ready
- **`HttpClient` Dependency:** Requires an instance of `HttpClient` (from the `http_client` package) configured with the SendGrid API base URL and API key, promoting loose coupling and testability.

> **üí° Your Advantage:** This package provides a robust and production-ready SendGrid integration for your email sending needs. It simplifies the process of sending transactional emails, leverages standardized error handling, and integrates seamlessly with the existing `http_client` and `email_client` architecture.
